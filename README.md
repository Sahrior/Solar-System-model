# Solar-System-model
Relatively correct solar system model
distance and speed in this model is releatively correct but the size is not....!

hello, welcome to the solar system....!
The speed and the distance 
in this model is relatively correct.
but the size is not..!
Speed: Kepler's Third Law states that the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit:

if mercury takes 1 second to round the sun 
from keplars third law we can say: 
Venus: 2.51 seconds
Earth: 4.11 seconds
Mars: 7.69 seconds
Jupiter: 48.68 seconds
Saturn: 121.65 seconds
Uranus: 345.89 seconds
Neptune: 675.82 seconds
Moon: 0.000541 seconds

If we scale the distance of Mercury from the Sun to 100 pixels, we can use the relative semi-major axes of the planets to calculate their distances in pixels. The semi-major axis values of the planets in astronomical units (AU)
Venus: 184.61 pixels
Earth: 256.41 pixels
Mars: 389.74 pixels
Jupiter: 1333.33 pixels
Saturn: 2455.36 pixels
Uranus: 4927.86 pixels
Neptune: 7705.15 pixels
